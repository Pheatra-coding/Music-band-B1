            <p>From the beginning we’ve had one goal: to empower artists to build effective websites for their music.</p>
            <p>It all started in 1999, with a single band website built by Bandzoogle's founder Chris Vinson for his alt-rock band, Rubberman. Grassroots promotion, plus the online community that the website created, helped the band get a record deal.</p>
            <p>In between tours, Chris worked at the record label designing websites for multi-platinum selling artists. To save time, he built a "control panel" to let artists make changes themselves. Realizing this could help independent bands and musicians build their own websites, Chris launched Bandzoogle in late 2003.</p>
            <p>As the needs of musicians have evolved, so has our mission to help them succeed online. Hired as Bandzoogle’s first support tech in 2007, Stacey Bedford became CEO in 2018. Named as a Billboard Digital Power Player in 2019, Stacey has helped expand the platform to include everything a musician needs to run a successful business online.</p>
            <p>From mobile design options, to commission-free music and merch sales, built-in crowdfunding, and fan subscriptions tools, now tens of thousands of artists from around the world use Bandzoogle to create beautiful websites and power their direct-to-fan marketing and sales.</p>
